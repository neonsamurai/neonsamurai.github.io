This blog is my scratch pad / outlet for all things web
development. My preferred topics at the moment are (among other things)

* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com), the greatest web framework
* [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), probably the greatest
  code editor
* [XCOM](http://www.xcom.com/), likely the best turn based tactics game

You are welcome to ask my anything.

Tim
